## Flatiron Students Present

### Overview
Starting midway through the immersive program students will participate in Flatiron Students Present. Each student will be paired with a partner and together they will prepare one 7-10 minute technical talk to present at FSP. FSP takes place on Tuesday nights at 6:15pm.


### Subjects
These talks should be about programming or programming-related topics. Be very conscious of the scope of your talk because it is common to pick too large a topic. As you are preparing your talk, you should practice delivering it and time yourself.

To give you an idea of appropriate topics, below is a list of FSP topics students have presented before:
- Test-Driven Development
- Amazon Web Services
- Arduino/Raspberry Pi
- OAuth
- Web Assembly
- Parallax
- GraphQL
- 3JS
- Creating a Ruby Gem

### Slides
You should have a Powerpoint/Google Slides to accompany your talk. Don't fill your slides with text, only highlight the most important points on your slides. Feel free to use fun photos or gifs.

### Code
Absolutely NO LIVE CODING. You can have code snippets in your presentation or take a gif of your code running and use that. If you use code snippets, make sure the code on the screen is under 10 lines. Any more than that is too much for the audience to process at once.
